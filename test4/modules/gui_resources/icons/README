This software includes icons distributed under open-source licenses.
Except as noted by an asterisk (*), these icons have not been modified from
the originals.  Images derived from these sources may be redistributed
under the original license terms.

We gratefully acknowledge the original artists for creating and freely
distributing these images.

----
Many icons (and derived images) were obtained from the Crystal Icons
project, which is distributed under the LGPL.  The original directory
structure has been preserved, but only icons actually used in PHENIX have
been included (in the 'crystal_project' subdirectory).

Many of the icons created specifically for PHENIX incorporate elements of
several of the Crystal Icons; therefore, these are also licensed under the
LGPL.
